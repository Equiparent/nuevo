Do not merge commits with main branch.

The project have a standard Next.js structure with app directory, components, and node_modules. 
The project's key files and structure:

1. Layout and page components (layout.tsx, page.tsx)
2. Component files (ServiceCard.tsx, SignUpButton.tsx, Button.tsx)
3. Configuration files (tailwind.config.ts, next.config.js)
4. API route handlers (none shown but would be in app/api/ directory)
5. Global styles (globals.css)

 The layout.tsx file shows the root layout component for the Next.js application. 
 Key observations:
Uses Inter font from Google Fonts with Latin subset
Sets metadata with title "EquiParents" and description about shared parenting organization
Uses HTML lang="en" and data-theme="fantasy" (likely DaisyUI theme)
Applies Inter font class to body element
Imports global styles from globals.css

The page.tsx file shows the main home page component. Key observations:

Uses multiple Link components for navigation
Includes SVG icons for navigation elements
Displays the EquiParents title and logo
Has links to Users and Register pages
Renders a ServiceCard component
Basic structure with main tag and h1 headings

The ServiceCard component is quite minimal, only rendering an AddToCart component. To better understand the service card functionality, I should examine the AddToCart component it imports.

The AddToCart component is a simple client component that renders a button with 'Add to Cart' text. Key observations:

Uses 'use client' directive since it has interactivity
Has a button with btn btn-primary classes (likely DaisyUI)
Currently just logs 'Click' to console on click
No state management or actual cart functionality yet

Information Gathered:

Current AddToCart component is a basic button that logs to console
ServiceCard component acts as a container for AddToCart
Home page displays the ServiceCard component
Project uses Next.js with Tailwind/DaisyUI for styling

Plan:

AddToCart.tsx

Implement actual cart functionality using state management
Add props to handle different products/services
Improve UI/UX with loading states and feedback
ServiceCard.tsx

Add props to display service details
Include price, description, and other relevant info
Improve layout and styling
page.tsx

Display multiple ServiceCards with different services
Add data fetching for service information
Improve overall page layout
layout.tsx

Ensure layout supports new cart features
Add any necessary global styles
Dependent Files:

globals.css: May need updates for new styles
tailwind.config.ts: If new utility classes are needed
package.json: If new dependencies are required
Followup Steps:

Implement changes in identified files
Test functionality thoroughly
Check for console errors/warnings
Optimize performance if needed
